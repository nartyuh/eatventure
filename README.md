## Project Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RestaurantAdvisor is the "google map" for restaurants. It is built to help travellers find the best nearby restaurants and get the necessary knowledge about the restaurant that they are looking into.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes things like sorting the star ratings of the restaurants in the local city (1-5 stars), filtering out the restaurants by types of meals (vegetarian, vegan, etc.), cuisines (Italian, Chinese, Japanese, etc), atmosphere (fine dining, bistro, cafe, etc.), as well as seeing the price range ($-$$$$).
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These types of information will let the customers choose what their next actions will be, such as making a reservation, looking through the menus, ordering a takeout, etc. As a result, all of these features should allow our customers to choose which restaurant that is a good fit for them, as well as leaving a review of a restaurant by giving a star rating and comments once they’re finished eating at the restaurant.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, the customer should not be able to change the restaurants’ data within the DB. Only accounts with certain granted admin privilege may change/update the restaurants’ data, as well as adding/removing restaurants to the DB.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, there will be two types of users in this app: the restaurant managers (those who are going to put their restaurants on the app and will have the ability to set prices, menus, etc), and the customers who are looking for restaurants to eat.
